## Summary

My Tableau story analyzes the trends in MLB salaries from 1985 to 2016. I explain the potential relationships between salary and various metrics, and highlight the interesting data points.

<br>

## Design

I used several types of visualizations to outline my findings. Deciding to use clustering in my scatterplots was the most productive design choice in explaining the relationships outlined in those sections. Clustering those data points, along with including the player's position in my data point callouts (see feedback) really helped tell the story more effectively. I also chose to switch from analyzing the total (sum) salary for each category to using the average salary. This was a suggestion given as feedback, and it helps explain the data points that were previously washed out by the fact that MLB teams have more pitchers on the roster than any other position.

## Feedback

The feedback I received on the first version of my Tableau story came from two people. The first suggested I look at average salary instead of the total (sum) salary. The second recommended I add the player's position to my scatterplots to help explain the data points I call out.
